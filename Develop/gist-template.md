# Matching Hex values using regular expressions!

This will be a turtorial on how to use regular expressions to find hex values

## Summary

this will be the regular expresion I will be evaluating:

/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors 
There are two anchors used in the hex regular expression. The anchors used are "^" & "$". The "^" just represents the beginning of the regular expression. The "$" represents the end of the regular expression.

### Quantifiers
There are two quantifiers used in thi regular expresion. The two quantifiers are "?" ang "{x}". 

The "?" matches anything that precedes it. In our regular expression we have "#?" so this will match anything that starts with "#".

We also have a {x} quantifier. This will match to x amount of characters in the search. So in the case of our expression we have {6} & {3}.
